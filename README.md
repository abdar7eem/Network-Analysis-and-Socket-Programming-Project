# Network-Analysis-and-Socket-Programming-Project

The project is centered on socket programming with a focus on TCP and UDP connections. Students are required to implement a variety of tasks, including network command testing using tools like ping, tracert, nslookup, and telnet, followed by developing client-server applications using TCP and UDP protocols. Additionally, they are tasked with building a simple web server capable of handling various HTTP requests and serving HTML and CSS content. The project requires teamwork, coding in languages such as Python, Java, or C, and producing a report that outlines the procedures, results, and discussions.

Purpose: The purpose of this project is to familiarize students with socket programming, network protocols, and web server implementation. It helps them gain practical experience with TCP/UDP communication, command-line network utilities, and creating a functional web server that responds to different types of requests. Through this, students also develop teamwork and problem-solving skills essential in network-based software development.

In the solution for the Network project, the team tackled three main tasks: using network commands and Wireshark to analyze network traffic, implementing TCP and UDP socket programming, and building a simple web server. In Task 1, the team used commands like ping, tracert, nslookup, and telnet to analyze the network connection to www.ox.ac.uk and capture DNS traffic using Wireshark. For Task 2, they developed Python programs for TCP and UDP client-server communication, where TCP replaced vowels in a client-sent string with '#' and returned the modified string, while the UDP server handled multi-peer messaging. In Task 3, the team built a web server using socket programming to handle HTTP requests, serve HTML/CSS content, and implement redirection and error handling. The server was tested with both English and Arabic versions of the website, along with redirections to external sites like StackOverflow and Birzeit University.

The purpose of this solution is to demonstrate the teamâ€™s understanding of networking concepts, TCP/UDP communication protocols, and web server implementation, while gaining practical experience in socket programming, network analysis, and basic web development.

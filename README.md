# Network-Analysis-and-Socket-Programming-Project

In the solution for the Network project, the team tackled three main tasks: using network commands and Wireshark to analyze network traffic, implementing TCP and UDP socket programming, and building a simple web server. In Task 1, the team used commands like ping, tracert, nslookup, and telnet to analyze the network connection to www.ox.ac.uk and capture DNS traffic using Wireshark. For Task 2, they developed Python programs for TCP and UDP client-server communication, where TCP replaced vowels in a client-sent string with '#' and returned the modified string, while the UDP server handled multi-peer messaging. In Task 3, the team built a web server using socket programming to handle HTTP requests, serve HTML/CSS content, and implement redirection and error handling. The server was tested with both English and Arabic versions of the website, along with redirections to external sites like StackOverflow and Birzeit University.

The purpose of this solution is to demonstrate the teamâ€™s understanding of networking concepts, TCP/UDP communication protocols, and web server implementation, while gaining practical experience in socket programming, network analysis, and basic web development.
